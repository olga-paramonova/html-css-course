        <div class="div_title_long"><h3>Internship Opportunities</h3></div>
        <div class="wide">
            <p>Local County Zoo is seeking dedicated and enthusiastic interns
                to work alongside Animal Care Specialists to assist in maintaining the animal collection. Interns are
                involved in various aspects of animal care, including daily husbandry, diet preparation and delivery,
                exhibit maintenance, behavioral enrichment preparation, animal observations, and informal educational
                interactions with Zoo guests. Education interns learn about current issues in conservation and learn to interpret them to guests. $150
                stipend available upon completion of internship.</p>
            <h5>TYPICAL DUTIES:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Interns will participate in eight classes with Conservation Education staff on Tuesday evenings
                    throughout
                    the internship. This will include both structured learning and hands-on experiences.
                </li>
                <li>Interns will commit to 10 hours of weekend shifts over the course of the internship. These shifts
                    will
                    involve engaging the public in conversation about conservation initiatives with the goal of
                    galvanizing
                    people to take action. This may include use of biofacts, providing education and outreach at
                    Zoo-sponsored
                    conservation days, and assisting with research and program development.
                </li>
                <li>The internship will culminate in a final project where students will identify a current problem
                    related
                    to
                    earth or biological sciences, and then propose solutions to their chosen problem which can be
                    incorporated
                    into future educational programming.
                </li>
            </ul>
